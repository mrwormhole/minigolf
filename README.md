# minigolf

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)


3D minigolf in C(17) and Raylib(4.6.0-dev).

Additionally [CONVENTIONS.md](https://github.com/mrwormhole/minigolf/blob/main/CONVENTIONS.md) is inherited from the creator of Raylib. And enforced for this repository. Please consider reading CONVENTIONS.md before opening a PR. Also ensure to run `valgrind` to avoid memory leaks on your code to increase confidence.
